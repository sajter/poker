# Poker
A free, open-source RedM script for VORP poker.

I am not responsible for this script; it is not my property. I converted the script from RSG to VORP, and the appearance has also been modified.  
Any changes will be updated; if you add something, please share it with others. Every new addition will be incorporated until we achieve the ideal free poker script.

Please make the language changes yourself, as I did them for my own use.

-  Ox_lib
-  Vorp

## Special Notes
NPC's were used to speed up testing and I might write up working npc code later once script is working for players.
I could not figure out how to change the faces on the cards that the players hold.
