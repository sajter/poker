# Poker
A free, open-source RedM script for poker vorp.

I am not responsible for the script; it is not my property. The script has been converted from RSG to VORP, and the appearance has also been modified. 
If anyone has the time and knowledge, please feel free to share with others. Every new addition will be updated until we reach the ideal free poker script.


Please make the language change yourself, as I did it for my own.

## Special Notes
NPC's were used to speed up testing and I might write up working npc code later once script is working for players.
I could not figure out how to change the faces on the cards that the players hold.
